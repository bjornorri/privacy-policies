# Privacy Policy for Vanish

**Effective Date:** April 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to the Vanish app ("Application"), created by Björn Sæmundsson as a commercial service. The Application is intended for use "AS IS".

## Collected Information

The Application itself does not collect personal information directly. However, third-party services integrated into the Application may collect certain information automatically, including:

- Device identifiers (such as the Advertising Identifier)
- Application usage data (e.g., screens visited, session duration)
- Device type and operating system

Precise location data is **not** collected.

## Usage of Collected Information

Collected information is used by third-party services to:

- Measure how users discover the Application through advertising outside the app
- Analyze app performance and usage patterns

No advertising is displayed within the Application itself. No personal information is sold or shared for unrelated purposes.

## Third-Party Services

The Application integrates third-party services that may collect and use information as described in their respective privacy policies. These services include:

- [Meta (Facebook) Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update/printable)

Information shared with these services is subject to their handling and retention practices.

## User Choices

Users have the right to control tracking permissions through the Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. Upon first launch, the Application may request permission to track activity across apps and websites for advertising attribution purposes.

Permissions can be changed at any time in device settings under **Privacy & Security > Tracking**.

To stop data collection, users can uninstall the Application at any time.

## Data Retention

The Application does not directly store personal data.  
Third-party services may retain collected data according to their own data retention policies.

## Children’s Privacy

The Application is not directed at children under the age of 13.  
No information is knowingly collected from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child has provided personal information, please contact [bjornorri@gmail.com](mailto:bjornorri@gmail.com) so appropriate action can be taken.

## Security

Reasonable measures are taken to protect any information processed by the Application or its integrated third-party services. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted within the Application or through other appropriate means. Continued use of the Application after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
